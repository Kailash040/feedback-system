# Feedback System Architecture

## Overview
The application is a full-stack feedback system with:
- Frontend: React (Vite.js) with Material-UI for styling
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM

## Data Flow
1. User submits feedback through the React form
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/feedback`
3. Backend validates and stores data in MongoDB
4. Dashboard requests feedback data via GET `/api/feedback`
5. Backend retrieves and filters/sorts data from MongoDB
6. Frontend displays the feedback in a table with filtering options

## Key Features
- Form validation on frontend
- Responsive design with Material-UI
- Filtering and sorting capabilities
- Category system for feedback organization
- Clean separation of concerns between frontend and backend

## Scalability Considerations
- Backend uses async/await for non-blocking operations
- MongoDB can easily scale with larger datasets
- Frontend is optimized with React's efficient rendering
- API endpoints are RESTful and well-structured
